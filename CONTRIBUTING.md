#### Types

Required. Must be one of the following:

- `build`: Changes that affect the build system configuration, package scripts, or external dependencies (i.e. adds/removes/modifies/updates any project, peer, or dev dependency)
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts (e.g. release configs, YAML scripts)
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `feat`: Adds a new feature
- `fix`: Fixes a bug in an existing feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Add missing tests or correct existing tests

#### Scopes

If applicable, use one of the following supported scopes:

- `api`: Any documentation that helps developers or end users understand how to better employ a tool or feature
- `contributing`: Contributions to this guidance or the [Code of Conduct](/../../blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- `license`: Changes to terms or copyright status within the [license](/../../blob/main/LICENSE). *NOTE: Any wholesale change in license type MUST include a BREAKING CHANGE.*
- `readme`: Contributions to the main [README.md](https://github.com/M-Scott-Lassiter/Alphanumeric-Encoder#alphanumeric-encoder)
- `security`: Changes that address code related security issues or security policies

#### Versioning Triggers

Pushes to the main branch causes `semantic-release` to [check all commits](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#commit-message-format) since the last version for any triggers that would cause a new version. This project extends the defaults:
- Patch
  - `build`
  - `fix`
  - `perf`
  - `(api)`
  - `(license)`
- Version
  - `feat`
- Major
  - `BREAKING CHANGE`

Any changes to the `api` and `license` scopes trigger a patch. This keeps documentation as a first-class citizen without patching for any and all changes to the README.
