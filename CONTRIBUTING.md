## Code of Conduct

Please help keep this project open and inclusive. Refer to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before your first contribution.

## How can I Contribute?

### Submit Issues

### Improve Documentation

Open a new issue [here](https://github.com/M-Scott-Lassiter/Alphanumeric-Encoder/issues).

For security related issues, see the [security policy](https://github.com/M-Scott-Lassiter/Alphanumeric-Encoder/security/policy).


## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment Setup

`alphanumeric-encoder` uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and updates automatically based on specific [versioning triggers](#versioning-triggers).


### Project Structure


### Linting

Linting is done with ESLint.

### Testing

Tests are run with Jest.

### Documentation

API Documentation is automatically generated from JSDoc comments within the scripts.

The table of contents in this guide and the main README are automatically generated using the [`markdown-toc`](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/markdown-toc) package.

### Commits

*This specification is inspired by and supersedes the [Angular Commit Message](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit).*

This project uses very precise rules over how Git commit messages must be formatted. This leads to **easier to read commit history**.

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body**, and a **footer**.

```
<header>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The `header` is mandatory and must conform to the [Commit Message Header](#commit-header) format.

The `body` is mandatory for all commits except for those of type "docs".
When the body is present it must be at least 20 characters long and must conform to the [Commit Message Body](#commit-body) format.

The `footer` is optional. The [Commit Message Footer](#commit-footer) format describes what the footer is used for and the structure it must have.

#### Commit Header Format

    <type>(<scope>): <short summary>
    │       │             │
    │       │             └─⫸ Summary in present tense. Not capitalized. No period at the end.
    │       │
    │       └─⫸ Commit Scope: api|contributing|license|readme|security
    │
    └─⫸ Commit Type: build|ci|docs|feat|fix|perf|refactor|test

**Types**

Required. Must be one of the following:

- `build`: Changes that affect the build system configuration, package scripts, or external dependencies (i.e. adds/removes/modifies/updates any project, peer, or dev dependency)
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts (e.g. release configs, YAML scripts)
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `feat`: Adds a new feature
- `fix`: Fixes a bug in an existing feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Add missing tests or correct existing tests

**Scopes**

Optional. If used, must be one of the following supported scopes:

- `api`: Any documentation that helps developers or end users understand how to better employ a tool or feature
- `contributing`: Contributions to this guidance or the [Code of Conduct](/../../blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- `license`: Changes to terms or copyright status within the [license](/../../blob/main/LICENSE). *NOTE: Any wholesale change in license type MUST include a BREAKING CHANGE.*
- `readme`: Contributions to the main [README.md](https://github.com/M-Scott-Lassiter/Alphanumeric-Encoder#alphanumeric-encoder)
- `security`: Changes that address code related security issues or security policies

### Versioning Triggers

Pushes to the main branch causes `semantic-release` to check all commits since the last version for any triggers that would cause a new version. This project extends the defaults:
- Patch
  - `build`
  - `fix`
  - `perf`
  - `(api)`
- Version
  - `feat`
- Major
  - `BREAKING CHANGE`

Extensions from the [semantic-release default](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#commit-message-format):
- `build` types trigger a patch to keep users and developers in sync with dependency changes.
- `api` scope (regardless of commit type) triggers a patch. This keeps documentation as a first-class citizen without patching for any and all changes to the README or other supporting docs.
